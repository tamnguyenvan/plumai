# Changelog

## [Aug 10, 2024] - ðŸŽ‰ Added support for Flux models.

- Added support for Flux models: [`flux.1-dev`](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) and [`flux.1-schnell`](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell).


## Supported Platforms

PlumAI currently supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

To install PlumAI, follow these steps:

1. **Verify System Requirements**:
- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2. **Install PlumAI**:

```bash
pip install plumai
```

This command installs PlumAI directly from the GitHub repository, including all necessary dependencies.

## Usage
After installation, you can use PlumAI with the following commands:

### Run a Flux model


```bash
plumai run [MODEL_NAME] [GPU_TYPE] [-f | --force]

# For example:
plumai run flux.1-dev A10G
```


- `MODEL_NAME`: Specify the model name to run. Options are:
  - flux.1-dev (default)
  - flux.1-schnell


- `GPU_TYPE`: Specify the GPU type to use. Options are:
  - T4 (not recommended)
  - A10G (default)
  - A100
  - L4
  - H100

- `f | --force`: Use this option to force redeployment of the model, ignoring the cache. If the model has already been deployed and cached, using `--force` will trigger a new deployment process.


## Troubleshooting
- Git or Python3 not installed:
If you encounter errors related to missing Git or Python3, install them using your system's package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git python3 python3-pip
```

- Modal Setup Issues:
If you encounter issues with Modal, ensure it is properly configured and installed. Refer to Modal's documentation for setup instructions.
